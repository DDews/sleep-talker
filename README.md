# Sleep-Talker - Text-speech obfuscator

This  hosts a web-api and webapp with user interface.

It allows a user to convert any english text into "sleep talked" text, by obfuscating english words to other english words with similar phonemes.


# Example

`Bears. Beets. Battlestar galactica.` -> `Bears. Beets. bacon galaxy.`

`The quick fox jumps over the lazy dog` -> `ther quickly forms jumps oder them lawyer donor`

`This is such a dumb application` -> `thigh is sushi a durban agri`

# Setup and Install

This project uses NodeJS v10.
If it is not already installed, I suggest using NVM to install and use NodeJS v10

Next, run the following commands:
`npm install`
if any auditing exceptions occur, follow the suggestions to fix any upgraded node modules.

next, run the application:
`npm start`

It should start hosting the webapp on port 3000.
Navigate in your browser of choice to: http://localhost:3000/
